What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n","   - The programming paradigm known as object-oriented programming (OOP) arranges software architecture around data, or objects, as opposed to logic and functions. Classes, which specify the attributes and actions that the objects will possess, are instances of objects in object-oriented programming. Encapsulation (hiding information), inheritance (making new classes from preexisting ones), polymorphism (letting multiple objects reply to the same message), and abstraction (simplifying large systems by exposing only important details) are some of the fundamental ideas of object-oriented programming (OOP)."],"metadata":{"id":"v_0ccVwIolDy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2. What is a class in OOP ?\n","   - In OOP, a class serves as a template for building objects, or instances. It specifies methods (functions) and attributes (data) shared by all objects of that class. Instances are particular realizations of a class that are created using the class as a template. A Car class, for instance, might have methods like start() and stop() in addition to characteristics like make and model. Classes aggregate related features and behaviors to assist structure and organize code."],"metadata":{"id":"NCiArkTxosyg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3. What is an object in OOP ?\n","   - In OOP, an instance of a class is called an object. Both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that manipulate the data are contained in this self-contained unit. The class serves as the blueprint for producing instances of objects, which are representations of real-world entities. With distinct values for characteristics like make, model, and color, an object of the Car class, for instance, may represent a particular car. Through their methods, objects exchange information with one another."],"metadata":{"id":"bwsbFijxpUA5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n","   - Although both abstraction and encapsulation are essential OOP ideas, they have different uses.\n","\n","   - The idea of abstraction is to display only an object's or system's key characteristics while concealing more intricate aspects. It streamlines user engagement by emphasizing pertinent features and techniques.\n","\n","   - Contrarily, encapsulation is the process of combining data (attributes) and methods (functions) that work with the data into a class and limiting access to certain parts of the class using private or protected access modifiers. Data integrity is protected in part by encapsulation.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"n6ydSNNdpn8x"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5. What are dunder methods in Python ?\n","   - Python special methods known as \"dunder methods\" (short for \"double underscore\") contain double underscores before and after their names, including \\__init__, \\__str__, and \\__add__. With the use of these methods, objects can communicate with built-in Python functions such as arithmetic, string conversion, and object creation. For instance, \\__add__ permits the use of the + operator with objects, \\__str__ specifies the string representation of an object, and \\__init__ is the constructor method. Customizing object behavior is made easier with Dunder methods."],"metadata":{"id":"9OyMide7q0Ns"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n","   - In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the process by which a new class (child class) inherits properties and methods from an existing class (parent class). This enables the child class to add or change its own unique features while reusing the parent class's code. Because specific behavior can be added to the child class and common functionality is centralized in the parent class, inheritance encourages code reuse. A Dog class, for instance, may inherit characteristics like name and age from an Animal class.\n","    "],"metadata":{"id":"ADXfbCKJrpRG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n","   - In OOP, polymorphism enables objects of different classes to react differently to the same method call. It means \"many shapes,\" and it happens when child class methods override a parent class method. This makes it possible for the same method to act differently depending on the object calling it. For instance, the Dog and Cat classes may have distinct definitions for the speak() method. Dynamic method binding and more flexibility are made possible by polymorphism."],"metadata":{"id":"niMpcAvFsN6k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n","   - In Python, encapsulation is accomplished by employing methods to change data and access modifiers to limit access to an object's internal data. Typically, characteristics that are not immediately accessible are preceded by an underscore (e.g., _private). Python permits the use of getter and setter methods to access or alter private variables that are defined with a double underscore (such as __balance) in order to preserve data integrity. This guarantees that internal states are shielded from external influence."],"metadata":{"id":"1XCtPugvv2RC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n","   - When a new object is generated from a class in Python, a special function called \\__init__() is called automatically. It establishes the object's initial state and initializes its attributes with predetermined values. For more flexible object construction, constructors let you take parameters or establish default values. For instance, \\__init__() in a Person class may initialize a new person object by accepting name and age inputs.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"57-2oBo_wGhW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n","    - A class method in Python is a method that can call other class methods or change class-level properties. It typically takes the class as its first parameter, and is called cls. The @classmethod decorator is used to define it. Static methods are used for class-related utility functions and do not accept class or instance arguments. The @staticmethod decorator is used to define it. Instead of being instances of the class, class and static methods are connected to the class."],"metadata":{"id":"EmrHIgdXwRvp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11. What is method overloading in Python ?\n","    - In certain programming languages, method overloading is the practice of defining several methods with the same name but distinct parameters. However, unlike other languages (like Java or C++), Python does not enable classical method overloading. Using variable-length parameter lists or default arguments, you can mimic overloading in Python. The kind or quantity of parameters given will subsequently determine how the function behaves."],"metadata":{"id":"cStHV2GIweun"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n","    - When a child class offers a particular implementation of a method that is already specified in its parent class, this is known as method overriding. The child class's overridden method shares the parent class's method's name, signature, and parameters. Child classes can alter or expand the behavior of inherited methods through overriding. To provide a unique implementation, a Dog class might, for instance, override the speak() method from an Animal class."],"metadata":{"id":"V0s1VqW_wsIx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13. What is a property decorator in Python ?\n","    - In Python, getter methods are defined in a class using the @property decorator, which allows properties to be accessed like regular attributes while methods are running in the background. Instead of storing an attribute as a basic value, this decorator enables it to be dynamically calculated. It is frequently used to calculate a value that depends on other qualities or to impose data validity. For instance, to prevent direct alteration, you can use @property to establish a read-only attribute."],"metadata":{"id":"iLjsG3hayjZx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n","    - Because polymorphism enables flexibility and scalability, it is essential to OOP. It makes code easier to develop and maintain by allowing distinct objects to react differently to the same message (method call). A program can handle many object types consistently thanks to polymorphism, which streamlines code and eliminates the need for intricate conditionals. When creating extensible systems, where new classes may be introduced without modifying the existing code, it is very crucial.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"m9tAXjk3y0hp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n","    - In Python, an abstract class is one that is intended to be subclassed and cannot be implemented directly. It has abstract methods, which are methods that need to be implemented by its subclasses but do not have an implementation in the abstract class. The @abstractmethod decorator and the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module are used to define abstract classes. They serve to impose a standard for derived classes to adhere to and establish a common interface for all subclasses."],"metadata":{"id":"tHm-pMH_y_jW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["16. What are the advantages of OOP ?\n","    - OOP offers a number of benefits:\n","    \n","      1) Code Reusability: Redundancy can be decreased by reusing existing code through inheritance.\n","\n","      2) Modularity: Code is easier to handle because it is arranged into discrete objects or classes.\n","\n","      3) Maintainability: OOP encourages the organization of functionality using methods and classes, which facilitates debugging and maintenance.\n","\n","      4) Scalability: It is possible to introduce new classes and features without compromising the functionality of current systems.\n","\n","      5) Abstraction: By concentrating on key components, complex systems can be made simpler.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"03iCegyHzRjX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable ?\n","    - Every instance of a class shares a class variable. It is defined outside of any methods but inside the class body. Data that is shared by all instances is stored in class variables.\n","\n","    - In contrast, an instance variable is specific to every instance of the class. It is used to store information unique to each object and is defined within the \\__init__ method. Only the particular object is impacted when an instance variable is changed.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ul5cSI85zkoJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["18. What is multiple inheritance in Python ?\n","    - When a class is descended from more than one base class, multiple inheritance takes place. A class can inherit properties and methods from several parent classes thanks to Python's support for multiple inheritance. Code reuse may result from this, but complexity and ambiguity may also arise, particularly if two parent classes specify the same method. Python handles these conflicts by deciding which class's function is called based on the method resolution order (MRO)."],"metadata":{"id":"aeAUSU2jz3qn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["19. Explain the purpose of \"\\__str__' and \"\\__repr__\" methods in Python ?\n","\n","    - To define string representations of objects in Python, utilize the special methods \\__str__ and \\__repr__.\n","\n","    - A user-friendly string representation for end users is created using the \\__str__ technique. The print() and str() functions call it.\n","\n","    - In contrast, the \\__repr__ function is used for development and debugging; it offers a more formal text representation that, when sent to eval(), should ideally reproduce the object. The function repr() calls it.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-y577fQ40BWK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python ?\n","    - In Python, methods from a parent class can be called using the super() function. It offers a means of extending or changing inherited methods by enabling the child class to call the parent class's method. It is frequently used in a subclass's \\__init__ method to guarantee that the parent class is initialized correctly. In situations involving multiple inheritance, super() is crucial to ensuring that the proper method resolution order (MRO) is adhered to.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jkvVLWGN1Who"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["21. What is the significance of the \\__del__ method in Python ?\n","    - When an object in Python is going to be destroyed, a special method called \\__del__ is invoked. Before an item is erased, it enables developers to specify cleanup operations, such shutting down files or releasing resources. It is generally advised to utilize context managers (with statement) for resource management because Python uses garbage collection and the timing of \\__del__ calls may be unpredictable.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FEc8hNkn1jM0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python ?\n","    - The @staticmethod decorator defines a method that does not depend on class or instance data. It does not take self or cls as arguments and can be called without creating an instance of the class. The @classmethod decorator, however, defines a method that takes cls as the first argument, which refers to the class itself. Class methods can modify class variables or call other class methods, and they are bound to the class, not instances."],"metadata":{"id":"yq8P2Eum13tq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance ?\n","    - Python's polymorphism enables distinct subclasses of a parent class to implement the same method in different ways. Even if the method call is made using a reference to the parent class, it will refer to the subclass's version of the method when a subclass overrides a method in the parent class. Depending on the subclass instance, the same method name can yield different results because to this behavior, which allows for a flexible design."],"metadata":{"id":"ASvx1qTk1-6_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["24. What is method chaining in Python OOP ?\n","    - In Python, executing several methods on the same object in a single line is known as method chaining. The object itself is returned by each method, enabling the calling of other methods on it. Classes that modify object state or have setter methods frequently use this. Conciseness and readability are enhanced by method chaining. Take obj.set_name(\"Alice\"), for instance.set_age (30).display() sequentially invokes a number of methods on the item of interest."],"metadata":{"id":"Qo_Ix3SU2Hrn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python ?\n","    - Python's __call__ method makes it possible to call a class instance similarly to a function. An object can act as a callable by defining the __call__ method, which allows code such as object() to call the method. This is helpful in situations where objects must be handled as functions, like function wrappers, or when you wish to add custom behavior to the way an object is \"called.\""],"metadata":{"id":"qYVoEwXt2Tgg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"J20D4izujWl5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["''' 1.
